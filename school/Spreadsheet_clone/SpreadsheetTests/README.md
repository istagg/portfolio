# Comments to Evaluators:

Tests that include creating a file and reading a file are all self contained and tests can be run independent
of each other. Test XML files are deleted after tests have run. Spreadsheet class is 100% covered.

# Assignment Specific Topics

Asked to write about good software practices. See solution level README.

# Consulted Peers:

Nate Tripp: Help figuring out how to write tests including XML files.

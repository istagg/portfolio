# Comments to Evaluators:

This project contains a GUI implementation that wraps up the abstract spreadsheet. This GUI allows users to input simple formulas, values, and string content.

# Assignment specific topics:

Asked to write about good software practices. See solution level README.

# Partnership

All code was completed via pair programming. Some work was done under individual dev branches. Being a small project, we just slowly pushed to master instead.

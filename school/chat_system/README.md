# Overview of the Networking_And_Logging functionality

This program provides two different interfaces. One to act as a simple chat client and the other
to act as a simple chat server. Using these two programs, we can connect multiple clients to a single
server and establish a simple chat room between participants. 


# Best Team Practices
It was effective having two brains working together to solve problems. Nate has more experience then Isaac
and helped Isaac learn some of the ins and outs of Visual Studio and C#. Ultimately Isaac felt that he learned a
lot and Nate was able to learn how to explain concepts better. Having two sets of eyes on the program helped keep the
number of bugs down. We were also able to approach the problem from different directions because of differing viewpoints.

One of the biggest difficulties was finding time to meet. Nate works full time and doesn't have a lot of free time
outside of work and school. There were also some family events that came up that challenged us and caused us to have
to move to a different day. Ultimately we made it work and were able to complete the assignment before the deadline.
Overall we felt that working together was effective. We did most of the work over zoom and sometimes it was hard not
talk over each other.

# Branching
For this project we did pair programming, but we each had out own development branches that we then merged into the master branch. 
We didn't really have any issues merging. Nate worked on his branch second so branch was a little weird since Nate needed some of Isaacs changes.

# Testing
For testing we initially tested against the instructors provided executables and our own client/server. After we ensured both of those were working
we started to debug the issues with both our own client and server.

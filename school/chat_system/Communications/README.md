# Comments to Evaluators:
This project contains the Networking class. It is used to establish connections between the server and the clients. It keeps track of connected 
clients and is able to send messages from one client to all other connected clients. These communications are all done via TCP. 

This project also includes a CustomFileLogger. This logger logs messages to a file to keep track of the status of the clients and servers that use the 
Networking class.

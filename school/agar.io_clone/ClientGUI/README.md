# Comments to Evaluators:
This file contains the GUI elements and the model for this project.

When inserting player data into the database, we used a sproc instead of hard coding the query into our GUI. This demonstrates GSP
since the sproc allows us to more easily change the query in the future. We are also able to access database elements more
easily through the sproc which means we are less likely to produce errors.

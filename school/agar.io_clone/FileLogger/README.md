# Comments to Evaluators:

This project contains the our custom file logger. This logger follows the following format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS AM/PM (thread id) -  5 character definition of the level
of the log message - the message.

# Assignment Specific Topics

We did not create an extension to prepend the date and time to log messages since we are the only user of our logger and we would like to see the date and time in
front of every message. If users wish to use their own logging format they can simply inject their own.

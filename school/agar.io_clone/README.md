# Overview of the Networking_And_Logging functionality

This program aims to clone the smash hit game Agar.io. The server is provided and our goal is to create a client. The server
handles collisions and placing food objects. The client receives all of the objects through JSON and deserializes them to display
in the world. A player collects food to increase their mass and can eat other players if their mass is larger. If you are eaten,
the game ends.

# Best Team Practices
It was effective having two brains working together to solve problems. Nate has more experience then Isaac
and helped Isaac learn some of the ins and outs of Visual Studio and C#. Ultimately Isaac felt that he learned a
lot and Nate was able to learn how to explain concepts better. Having two sets of eyes on the program helped keep the
number of bugs down. We were also able to approach the problem from different directions because of differing viewpoints.

One of the biggest difficulties was finding time to meet. Nate works full time and doesn't have a lot of free time
outside of work and school. There were also some family events that came up that challenged us and caused us to have
to move to a different day. Ultimately we made it work and were able to complete the assignment before the deadline.
Overall we felt that working together was effective. We did most of the work over zoom and sometimes it was hard not
talk over each other.

# Branching
For this project we did pair programming, but we each had out own development branches that we then merged into the master branch. 
We didn't really have any issues merging. Nate worked on his branch second so branch was a little weird since Nate needed some of Isaacs changes.

# Testing
Testing was conducted using the provided server. It was a more 'guess and check' approach.
